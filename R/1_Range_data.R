# Code to swap out ranges with a "skinny format" dataframe
# Input: Birdlife Maps (individual, since smaller size, easier bug fixing)
# Output: Dataframe with 4 columns: Species, Cell,percent of cell occupied, origin


##Origin
#1	Native
#The species is/was native to the area
#2	Reintroduced
#The species is/was reintroduced through either direct or indirect human activity
#3	Introduced
#The species is/was introduced outside of its historical distribution range through either direct or indirect human activity.
#4	Vagrant
#The species is/was recorded once or sporadically, but it is known not to be native to the area.
#5	Origin Uncertain
#The speciesâ€™ provenance in an area is not known (it may be native, reintroduced or introduced).
#6	Assisted Colonisation
#Species subject to intentional movement and release outside its native range to reduce the extinction risk of the taxon.
